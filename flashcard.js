let response = prompt('What exactly is JavaScript? \n');

window.alert(`JavaScript is what makes a web page both dynamic and interactive. It allows the page to update and take
 input from the user and produce a result, whether it is loading another site or doing a mathematical process\n 
Your response: ` + response);

let response2 = prompt("What is JavaScript capable of doing?" );
window.alert(`JavaScript is capable or storing variables and using them to execute complex mathmatical equations.
It can use logical statements to solve complex problems and provide results based on those operations.
It can compare data that is provided and execute progams or display results based on logical arguments.
With the continous dedication to update JavaScript its' capabilities seem limitless.
\n Your response: ` + response2);

let response3 = prompt(`What does the 'typeof' operator do?`);
window.alert(`The 'typeof' operator outputs in a string, what type of datatype a variable is
\n
Your response: ` + response3);

let response4 = prompt(`What are some data types in JavaScript?`);
window.alert(`undefined
string
number
boolean
object
\n your response: ` + response4);
let response5 = prompt(`What is the difference between JScript and JavaScript?`);
window.alert(`There is fundamentally no difference. JavaScript was provided by Netscape and Microsoft calls it JScript to avoid copyright issues
\n` + response5);

let response6 = prompt(`Is Java and JavaScript the same thing? If not, what are the differences/ similarities`);

window.alert(`No. They are completely different languages
Java, I typically used in backend development. It is strongly typed, is completely object oriented.
It is a compiled language, will run in any virtual machine, is thread based and supports multithreading.
JS is used in front end development. Is weakly typed and doesn't fully support object oriented programming.
It is interpreted and has to be used in a browser, it is thread based and doesn't support multithreading.\n

Your response: ` + response6);
let response7 = prompt(`Is JavaScript case sensitive? What type of case is typically used with it?`);
window.alert(`JavaScript is very case sensitive, it typically is written in camel case.\n

Your response: ` + response7);
let response8 = prompt(`Is there a method for making notes while writing JS?`);
window.alert(`Yes, we use // to created a line that is ignored by the computer, to make comments, we can also use */, /* to comment out an entire block of code\n
Your response: ` + response8);

let response9 = prompt(`What makes a function different from the basics of creating a variable and using math to log a result? `);
window.alert(`When using a function, the computer reads the method before it has the arguments, remembers the math and reads the
arguments later, then passes it into the structure of the function and returns a result. A function can be used over and over with different parameters by passing
the arguments into the function, later in the code. \n Your response: ` + response9);

let response10 = prompt(`How many different types of operators does JS use to compare values? list them.`);
window.alert(`JS uses two operators for comparing values == and ===. == only compares the value and === compares the value as well as the data type. Note: A single
= is used to assign a value to a variable`);

let response11 = prompt(`What data type is used to compare values and what symbols are used in this operation?`);
window.alert(`Comparing variables is called a Boolean operation, we use ==, ===, <, >, <=, >= to compare them\n Your response: ` + response11);

let response12 = prompt("How can we use Boolean operators to make complex arguments is JS? what is that is that called? what symbols does that process include?");
window.alert(`We use logical operators with comparison operators to make decisions in JS. || "or" && "and" operators can be used to chain comparison operators together
to make more complex decisions/n Your response: ` + response12);

let response13 = prompt(`Does JS support automatic type conversion?`);
window.alert(`Yes it does`);

let response14 = prompt(`What is an Array in JS?`);
window.alert(`An array is a unique way to store a list of variables that makes them accessible with a number of commands in the code\n Your response: ` + response14);

let response15 = prompt(`How do you create an array in JS?`);
window.alert(`An array in JS script begins like any variable with a declaration (var, let, const), the contents of the array are encompassed by []. This tells the computer
that the variable is an array\n Your response: ` + response15);

let response16 = prompt(`How is the data in an array accessed?`);
window.alert(`The variables inside an array are accessed using the [] with the number of the index of the array inside the []. The variables are numbered starting with 0 and
 counting up.\n  Your response: ` + response16);

let response17 = prompt(`What is the 'NaN' property in JS`);
 window.alert(`NaN denotes when something that is outputed and not a legally number in JS`);

let response18 = prompt(`What does 'Undefined' mean in JS?`);
window.alert(`Undefined means that a variable has been declared but it was never assigned a value.\n Your response: ` + response18);

let response19 = prompt(`What are closures in JS?`);
window.alert(`Closures make variables inside a function only locally accessible and gives the function access to global variables.\n Your response: ` + response19);

let response20 = prompt(`what is callback method?`);
window.alert(`A callback function passes arguments to a function when some action has been completed, they prevent the computer from waiting for the arguments.\n Your response: `);
